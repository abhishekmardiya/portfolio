I'm a Software Developer Engineer with a strong focus on JavaScript, especially in the React and Next.js ecosystem. I enjoy building fast, responsive, and user-friendly web applications that make a real impact.

With a few years of experience under my belt, I've worked on everything from dynamic UIs to API integrations â€” always aiming for clean, maintainable code. I keep up with modern frontend trends, love refining performance, and never say no to a well-organized codebase.

Outside of coding, I like exploring new tools, simplifying workflows, and occasionally getting excited over a perfect Lighthouse score.

Focused on building useful things. Always learning. Always shipping..`}
